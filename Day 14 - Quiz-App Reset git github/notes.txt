There are environment for Deployment:-

    - QA(Quality Assurance) environment (https://qa.internalproductname.com)
    - UAT(User Acceptance Test) environment (https://uat.realproductname.com)

// Source Control:-

    Source Control or Version Control is a software development practice to track each and every change made to the
    source code. The software which helps us to manage this is called Source Control Manager or Version Control Manager

    The SCM/VCM helps track all the changes at once place there by creation a version for every single set of change.
    Which means that it maintains a history of all the changes/versions.

    What are the benefits:-
    - Collaboration
    - Sharing of files/source
    - Maintening the version history.


    Advantages from Architect/Managerial perspective
    - Quality:- With the help of code reviews.
    - Acceleration:- In the Project Implementation. By enabling multiple team members to work on the Project
    parallely and asynchronously. This helps take up multiple features and with the help of DevOps, CI/CD change
    be setup for frequent and planned deployments.
    - Visibility:- Entire team can see what is going on with the project source code because it is acting like single
        source of truth. Thereby increasing transparency.


    Following are the types of Source Control/Verson Control:-
    - Localized:- Maintaining all the changes locally and sent as one to a database or server. At any given point 
        in time only version available to the Team.
    - Centralized Source Control Manager(CSCM):- It is having a central server accessible to the team where collabaration
    an happen and it tracks all the changes done to the central server.
    - Distributed Source Control Manager(DSCM):- Apart from Central server, it enables the developer to have his own copy of
    repository and all versions which enables him to work from multiple computers, offline and asynchronously.
    Distributed architecture makes branching and merging seamless. It's very light weight it terms of branching and it 
    encourages to have your own feature/development branch.

    Examples:-
        CSCM:- Subversion
        DSCM:- git, mercurial.

* Creator of git:- Linus Torvalds.


bitbucket:- It is also a service based on git source control manager.
github:- Service which incorporates git DSCM. And provides APIs and UI to manage code bases.


Git Basic Commands:-

    - git init  // initializes the local git respository
    - git clone // it helps copy/clone the remote repository to local system.
    - git add   // it brings all the changes in the current branch to Staging area/space.
    - git commit    // it commits/create a version in the local respository for the working branch.
    - git branch    // working space for developer, which is light weight because it doesn't make a fully copy of the project by just keeping a link to original file.
    - git pull  // pulls the latest changes for the current branch from the remote respository.
    - git push  // push, send Commits/Versions created in the local branch and repository to remote server respository.
    - git merge // Merges changes from one branch to another.
    - git status // to check the status of current branch
    - git checkout // to switch branch.


Installing git scm:-
    - Go to website https://git-scm.com/
    - Download for your operating system.
    - install the application.


For Linux installation
    Ubuntu/debian:- sudo apt-get install git
    Fedora:- sudo dnf install git



// The Reset Functionality:-

    - We have add a new button with text Reset near the submit button.
    - On Click of this button, we want the quiz to come back to original state.
