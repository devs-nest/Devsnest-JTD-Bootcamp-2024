// The Box Model:-
    The CSS way of understanding and laying out the Boxes or elements. This is one of the most important and fundamental concept to understand how CSS works?.
    - content:- the text or any other element(s) in the box.
    - padding:- the area or gap created after the content and before the box boundary.
    - border:- the outline of the box or element.
    - margin:- the distance or gap between given or this element and other elements outside.


 padding can have 1 to 4 values
 examples:- padding: 10px;  // with one value => Applies to all 4 sides.
            padding: 10px 20px; // with two values => The first value represents top & bottom of the box.
                                                   => The second value is left & right of the box.
            padding: 10px 20px 30px;    // with three values => The first value gets applied as top.
                                                        => The second value gets applied as left & right.
                                                        => The third value gets applied as bottom;
            padding: 10px 20px 30px 40px;   // with four values it gets applied in TRBL fashion
                                            => top right bottom left.
                             Analogy to understanding purpose you can say or use acronym like TRBL.

borders:- border: 1px solid;
          border-bottom: 2px solid;
          border-bottom-width: 2px;
          border-bottom-color: black;
          border-bottom-style: solid;

margin: can have 1 to 4 values
Examples:- margin: 10px;  // with one value => Applies to all 4 sides.
            margin: 10px 20px; // with two values => The first value represents top & bottom of the box.
                                                    => The second value is left & right of the box.
            margin: 10px 20px 30px;    // with three values => The first value gets applied as top.
                                                        => The second value gets applied as left & right.

            margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px;   // with four values it gets applied in TRBL fashion
                                            => top right bottom left.

Block Box & the Inline Box:-
    -- Two types of boxes, these defines how the boxes behave with respect to eachother in a page flow.

    Outer Display Type:- impacts or effects how the outer elements are going to be laid out
        in the container/parent box.
        -- block => laws of behaviour
            - The box starts or break on to the new line.
            - The width and height is respected.
            - The padding, margin, border gets applied and causes other elements to shift away.
            - When there is no width is provided or applied on this box then it tries to cover up the
              parent/container space. In most cases, it occupies the entire avaiable space in container.
            examples:- p, div, h1 etc.
            
        -- inline => laws of behaviour
            - The box doesn't break on to the new line.
            - The width & height is not going to impact the layout.
            - The top & bottom for padding, margin & border will not cause other elements to move away.
            - The left & right for padding, margin & border will cause other inline elements to move away.
            examples:- span, anchor, em, strong etc.
    Inner Display Type:-
        The default beviour unless explicitely overridden by other display values for block and inline both.
        Means the element's default display value is respected with in the box.
        This is called as natural flow or page flow etc.

CSS Units:- px, em, rem.
        px:- pixels on to the screen.
        em:- Relative unit, from parent element/box.
        rem:- Relative unit, from root element which is html element.
