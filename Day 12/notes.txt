// Error Handling/Exception Handling

    The scenarios for errors that may occur are called Exceptions in coding context so as to act on the occurance of those 
    errors or handling the exceptions at run-time.
    In JavaScript, we can use try catch block to handle the runtime exceptions.

    try statement
    catch statement
    finally statement

    3 ways of writing

        try...catch
        try...finally
        try...catch...finally

    when does finally get executed?

    - After all the statements within the try block gets executed.
        The next thing is finally block code.
    - After all the statements in Catch block in case of error in try block
        The next thing is finally block code.
    - Before all the control flow statements like return, break, continue, throw etc gets executed within try and catch.


// Validation

    Generally happens for two things:-
        - Data Validation
        - Functionality Validation.
    
    We use validation to make sure the behaviour of control or UI is per the agreed upon rules.
