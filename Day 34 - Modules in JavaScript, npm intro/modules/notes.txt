// Modules in JavaScript

Background:- Division of complex and bix code in meaninful functional and technical chunks is module.

    Earlier Modules system
        - AMD -  
        - CommonJS - NodeJS
        - UMD - Works with both AMD and CommonJS

ES6 module system:-

What is Module?
    Simply a .js file itself acts like a module.

    We can have a code in a file that is stratetically exposing only what it is intended to expose.

    - export:- export keyword is used by the module to expose the public functionality to the world or consumer.
        We can export the top level function, variables, classes etc.
    - import:- import keyword is used by the module that wants to consume the exported functionality.

    Use Strict by default:-

    Modules are loaded with defer:-

    Basic of Modules:-

    Default Export:-
        Also this is for compatibility with earlier modules systems like AMD and CommonJS.

    Module objects:-
        When you say import * <objName>, an object is imported which is a module namespace object.
        All that is exported from the imported module are the properties of this object.
        Ex - import * as userModule from './user.js';

    Aggregating Modules:-
        Combining one module in to another and exposing it from current module.
